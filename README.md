# ATM-System
This project is a console-based Java application simulating an ATM system. It was developed as part of the Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The application provides users with the ability to perform essential banking operations such as viewing transaction history, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and transferring money to other users.

Features:-

1.User Authentication:-
*Users can log in with a valid User ID and PIN.
*Only authenticated users can access ATM services.

2.Transaction History:-
*View a detailed history of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers).

3.Withdraw Money:-
*Users can withdraw money from their account, ensuring sufficient balance is available.

4.Deposit Money:-
*Users can deposit money into their account, and the balance updates accordingly.

5.Transfer Money:-
*Transfer funds to another registered user using their User ID.
*Ensures the transfer does not exceed the current balance.

6.Exit System:-
*Option to exit the application safely.

Technologies Used:-

*Programming Language: Java
*Tools: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred Java IDE

Sample Users for Testing:-
*User ID: user123
*PIN: 1234
*Initial Balance: $1000.00

Learning Outcomes:-

*Implemented object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and inheritance.
*Gained experience in handling user inputs and performing validations.
*Developed a real-world application with multiple features for user interaction.
